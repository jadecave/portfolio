# UIB Portfolio Project

---

### Objective

Create a personal portfolio website that accurately represents your accomplishments, skill sets, and experience. This portfolio will be the first introduction between you and a prospective hiring manager. Hiring managers are looking for skill and professionality, not irrelevant past experience, excessive personal content, goofy memes, or anything that distracts them from your hireability.

Use this opportunity to create a clean, attractive portfolio that you can use to showcase your abilities as a professional web developer. Keep it direct and helpful.

### Requirements

These requirements are a list of things that must be kept in mind when working on the project, not instructions of which order to follow when creating the portfolio.

- Design, create and deploy your own professional website - demonstrate your proficiency in all of the skills you have learned up to this point
- Do not use online templates, JavaScript or any other technologies we have not yet covered in the course - you can always implement new technologies and frameworks in the future
- Site should be fully responsive and accessible
- Best practices concerning UI/UX need to be adhered to
- Before coding anything, establish your workflow and environments (directories, GitHub repo, wireframes(This is the structure of the page, more info in references link) , color palette, images)
- Have completed portfolio proofread by at least one peer
- Dare to be different and make it your own!

### Guideline

- This repository is only for developing your portfolio, ***NOT FOR DEPLOY***. You will be able to push here your updates so the teachers can see it. 
- Do the design first, ask yourself these questions about your web page:
   - How many pages/html files do I need ?
   - What do I want to transmit with each page?
   - What should be the structure of each page on a small screen?
   - What should be the structure of each page on a big screen?
   - Which special features(e.g. animations, dropdowns menus...) each page will have? These features are for big screens, small screens or both? 
   - Will my CSS be too big? If so, will it be better to use many CSS files or go for SASS/SCSS?
- Once you have the answer these questions and done the design, think of which approach you would like to use: Mobile First Design or Desktop First Design
- Once the approach is selected, create the folder organisation. Create folders for images, CSS, SASS/SCSS if you decided to use them and for the secondary pages. At the end you should have the `index.html` in the root folder and all the other files in their respective folder.
- Now you can start with the code. Try to go one page at a time. When you finish one, see what you can reuse from one page to another.
- At the beginning do just the essential structure for each page. This will consume less time than adding immeadiately fancy stuff like animations.
- Once you finish the essential structure ask your teacher for a quick review.
- Work on the feedback given and then you can focus on make your pages look better.
- Once you decide your page is ready for deploy, create a new repository on your github account. Copy your portfolio files into a new folder localy and in this new folder initiate the respository you just create it in your account. Push your portfolio to your new github repository and from here you will deploy the portfolio. (If you need help with this ask the teachers!) 

### What to include:

- Profile picture (optional)
- Contact information
- Working links to **relevant** social media presence (GitHub, Linkedin)
- Links to at least three completed projects
- Brief introduction and personal mission statement

### What NOT to include:

- Links to personal social media accounts
- Political / religous content
- Remember this is a public facing portfolio, so avoid using silly photos, gamer tags, gifs etc.
- Any personal information or opinions unrelated to yourself as a professional and hireable web developer

### Presentation

You will be expected to present your portfolio to the class on the last day of the module. Concentrate on explaining your content and design choices, workflow, and discussing any particular difficulties or triumphs.

In the event that you are unable to complete the project, you will still be expected to present your portfolio as a work in progress (WIP).

Your classmates and teachers will be encouraged to ask questions about your project and offer constructive criticism and feedback.

Think of this as an opportunity to present your work as you would in a professional development position or during the hiring process for such a position. Communication skills are important!

Remember, this is not a competition! This is all about mutual support, sharing and positive encouragement.
